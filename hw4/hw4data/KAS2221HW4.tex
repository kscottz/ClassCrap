\section{Problem 1}

 \[
img(i,j)=\alpha^{\prime\prime} +2\alpha^{\prime} + A(c+k)+Bf 
\]
This means the total number of calculations (ignoring the calculations need to start a new row) is $4MN$ additions and $3MN$ additions. For large images the setup cost is negligible and these terms dominate. 
\section{Problem 2}
Given the Hough equation 
\[
0 = x\sin{\theta}-y\cos{\theta}+\rho
\]
we rearrange to get:
\[
\rho = y\cos{\theta} - x\sin{\theta}
\]
Now we want to get this in the form of $y=A\cos{(\theta+\phi)}$ so we can rationalize about the underlying sinusoid. We convert $x$ and $y$ to polar coordinates, namely $x=r\cos{\phi}$ and $y=r\sin{\phi}$ to get:
\[
\rho = r \cos{\theta}\sin{\phi}-r\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi}
\]
We now use the following trig identity:
\[
\sin{(\theta-\beta)}=\sin{\theta}\cos{\beta}-\cos{\theta}\sin{\beta}
\]
Which yields (replacing r with its true value):
\[
\rho = \sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}
\sin{(\phi-\theta)}
\]
Where
\[
\phi = cos^{-1}{(\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}})}
\]
It is clear from this equation that in Hough space $x$ and $y$ directly relate to the phase and amplitude of the resulting sinusoid, with the length of the point from the origin relating to the amplitude and the angle from y-axis relating to the phase shift. The period/frequency of the sinusoid is completely independent of the $x$ and $y$ values.
